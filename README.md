# Nanodegree Portfolio
A collection of projects completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

### Jupyter Data Analysis
**Baseball Statistics**

This project used Sean Lahman's Major League Baseball data set to investigate
whether or not the level of professional baseball players had, overall, improved.
The inquiry was limited from 1955 to 2017 and placed an emphasis on batter ability
(measured with On-Base plus Slugging) and pitcher ability (measured with Fielding
Independent Pitching).

*Highlights*

* No trend, positive or negative, was observed in player ability.

* Environmental factors (like changing the strike zone) account for much more variability
in statistics than player ability.

* Uses Python, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy.


### R Exploratory Data Analysis
**U.S. College Statistics**

This project investigated a few key variables from College Scorecard, a dataset
created by the U.S. Department of Education to evaluate universities across the
nation. An emphasis was placed on four-year universities with variables related
to admissions, finances, and location.

*Highlights*

* There appears to be a noticable trend relating tuition and five-year
completion rates.

* There is also a distinct correlation between funding type (public, non-profit,
for-profit) and completion rate.

* Uses R and ggplots.
